Hi team,

I've created a new task folder within the day4 directory, which contains tasks covering multiple topics we've covered so far. The files prefixed with "level1" are mandatory. The "level0" and "level2" files are optional.

To streamline your focus on code functionality, I've included answer snippets with each question. Simply copy the code snippet to your local system, add your answer below the comment in each file, and run the file to verify correctness.

Example:
Q1
Access and print the third element of the array.
```javascript
function printThirdElement() {
    var array1 = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50];
    // Add your code here to print the third element i.e. 30.
    
}
printThirdElement();
```

Answer:
```javascript
function printThirdElement() {
    var array1 = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50];
    // Add your code here to print the third element i.e. 30.
    console.log(array1[2]);
}
printThirdElement();
```

Simply follow these steps for each task to ensure everything runs smoothly.
