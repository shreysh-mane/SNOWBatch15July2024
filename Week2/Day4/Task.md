Complete the following practicals:
0. Log into the platform using your own profile.
1. Create a filter in the users list and save it.
2. Practice using wildcards: Filter the list using different wildcards and observe the results.
3. Explore the context menu options we discussed in class.
4. User Creation: Create 2 users and assign them the ITIL role.
5. User Creation 2:
   a. Create 2 locations in the location table.
   b. Create 2 departments in the department table.
   c. Create 2 countries.
   [Hint: Modules to create locations, departments, and countries are available in the User Administration application.]
   d. Create 6 users and assign 3 users to each department created in task b.
   e. Create 2 groups named "Incident Managers Group" and "Problem Managers Group."
   f. Assign the incident manager role to the Incident Managers Group and the problem manager role to the Problem Managers Group.
   g. Add 3 users each in both groups.
  
6. Incident Management: Create incidents and check all the options. Create at least 3 incident records with different callers and assignment groups. Understand the workings of priority, category, and subcategory. Check the effect on the "Assign To" field when you change the group in the assignment group field. Reopen the incident after the support team member resolves it and check its effect on the state of the incident record. Check if the assigned person directly closes the incident, does the end user have the option to reopen it?

[Suggestion: Please use proper names for departments, countries, and users you create. Do not use names like dept1, user1, user2.]
